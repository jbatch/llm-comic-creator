- Maintain visual continuity between panels

# Visual Elements to Include
- Character positions and actions
- Facial expressions and body language
- Key environmental details
- Important props or objects
- Camera angle and framing suggestions

# Output Format
Provide response as JSON with the following structure:
{
  "panels": [
    {
      "imagePrompt": "Detailed visual description of what should be seen in the panel"
    }
  ]
}

# Example Panel Description
Good: "A young woman stands at her open front door, backpack over shoulder, frozen mid-step. Her eyes are wide with shock as she stares at her normally tidy living room, now completely trashed with furniture overturned and papers scattered everywhere. Afternoon sunlight streams in through the window, highlighting the chaos."

Bad: "Sarah feels afraid when she discovers her home has been broken into and realizes her privacy has been violated."

# Note
- Focus on what can be seen, not what characters are thinking or feeling
- Descriptions should be detailed enough for image generation
